Project Name: PL Network Team Directory and Index
=================================================

Overview
--------

This project aims to streamline the process of managing and showcasing teams within the Protocol Labs Network. It involves fetching team data from the PL directory, transforming that data into a desired format, writing data to ComposeDB, and then interacting with the Index Network SDK to create an index of teams.
